# About

This repository tracks the projects I've completed on my journey to learn Swift with Dr. Angela Yu through the iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp course available on Udemy.com.

I would go through numerious sections per week to be able to learn the information as fast as possible but I would also go back to older projects to brush up on concepts that were previously touched to help solidify them in my mind.

At the beginning of the course, I knew nothing about Swift but I do have experience working with C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and some other programming languages but I really wanted to learn how to develop iOS apps. After this course I hope to develop an iOS app on my own without help and upload my app to the Apple AppStore.
